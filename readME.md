# Sky Rider Game
Sky Rider Game is a Java graphic game that was developed from a Space Invaders game built by my programming teacher. It means to challenge players to dodge all obstacles to achieve the highest miles.

My team of three developers were addicted to Jetpack Joyride game. We were inspired to develop a similar game but in our version when we were in highschool.

## How does Sky Rider game work?
1. Call a game loop to draw a home page
2. Press 1 to change game state to "gameMode" to start the game
3. Repeat the game loop to draw charactor, backgrond and obstacles
4. Press up/down arrow to vertically control a charactor
5. Apply the gravity to the charactor
6. Generate random obstacles and bonus coins on the screen moving horizontally toward the charactor
7. Repeat the game loop to update new charcator and obstacles positions every millisecond
8. Change game mode to "loseMode", draw a score and reset the game if collision is detected

## Key skills
* Java
* Java OOP
* Java Canvas
** Teamwork!

## What is missing
This is the first programming project that I worked in a team to complete. At the end, some components can be improved.
1. Calculate a position to generate obstacles to avoid overlapping
2. Set a limit acceleration for the obstacles
3. Avoid generating too much obstacles on the screen
4. Make a moving graphic for a charactor
